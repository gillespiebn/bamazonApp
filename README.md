# bamazonApp
Amazon-like storefront using MySQL and node.js.
Application shows an inventory of items, prompts user to pick an item by its item ID then asks how many of that item the user would like to purchase. If the inventory has enough of that item it will add up the price, if it does not have enough of that item the program will alert the user that the inventory is insufficient.
